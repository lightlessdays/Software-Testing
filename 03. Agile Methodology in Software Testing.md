# 03. Agile Methodology in Software Testing

The agile methodology used in the Software development lifecycle focuses on the parallel execution of development and testing at each stage of the development process. Traditionally, the waterfall model was used, which focused on completing one stage before moving on to the next phase of the lifecycle. Agile methodology is faster and much more practical in resource utilization. Now, you know what is agile methodology, let's look at how is it different from the waterfall model.

## Waterfall Model versus Agile

| Waterfall Model | Agile Methodology |
| --- | --- |
| In the waterfall model in SDLC, One phase needs to get completed before moving on to the next phase of the lifecycle | The agile model in SDLC uses a concurrent iteration of the development and testing cycle in each phase |
| The waterfall model is used more where there is a requirement for R&D | The agile model is a practical model used nowadays |
| Waterfall model cannot make use of multiple resources concurrently | The agile model has the optimization of resources |
| The waterfall model is relatively much slower than the agile approach | The agile model is a faster approach to building a product |
| For new bugs or features, the entire STLC has to be followed from the beginning, making it a slower approach | New features or bug is handled much faster in agile |

## Agile Methodologies

* **Scrum:** Scrum is a framework for agile methodology. Scrum uses the concept of sprints. A task that has to be delivered in three months is divided into sprints of 2 weeks. Those smaller durations are called sprints. They make the overall developer cycle easy to manage and deliver.
    
    **Scrum has three roles:**
    
    1. **Scrum Master:** Scrum master is the team lead responsible for setting up the team, sprinting meetings, and managing the development cycle.
        
    2. **Product Owner:** The product owner is the project manager. The manager is responsible for including client feedback, maintaining the backlog, prioritizing the backlog, and ensuring project delivery.
        
    3. **Scrum Team:** Scrum Master, Product Owner, Business Analyst, Developers, and testers conclude the Scrum team. Everyone has a specific role and collaborates to deliver the product to the client.
        
* **Extreme Programming(XP):** Extreme Programming, as the name suggests, has frequent milestones in product delivery where after every few weeks, a version of the product needs to be released to the client. It also is the best framework when clients' requirements keep on changing. **, For example,**, some clients ask for a product prototype to be delivered with the basic functionalities. Then after a few weeks, a meeting is called where the model is detailed.
    
* **Crystal Methodology:** Crystal methodology is a lightweight framework consisting of three concepts:
    
    1. **Chartering:** Here, all the prerequisites to the development cycle are done. Requirement gathering, creating a team, defining the development and testing cycle and tools. The initial plan of the product delivery is laid down here.
        
    2. **Cyclic Delivery:** The product is delivered in multiple cycles. Functionalities are developed in due release time. The developed functionalities are tested and released. Integrated product is delivered to the users as well.
        
    3. **Cycle Closure:** The development cycle is closed here. Maintenance, deployment, and ensuring the product is live, defect-free, and maintained for any required change.
        
* **Feature Driven Development(FDD):** Feature Driven Development methodology focuses on developing one particular functionality at a time. That is two weeks of the sprint cycle, where the functionality is broken into requirement gathering, designing, development, testing and ultimately released. Once released, the entire team works together to deliver the next functionality.
    
* **Dynamic Software Development Method(DSDM):** Dynamic model focuses on building a prototype with basic requirements and releasing it into the market. Now the feedback from the users would be incorporated into the product, new requirements would get added, and the cycle would continue. So, during the development process, user interaction is there any product keeps on evolving. This framework is used highly in bootstrapped startups where user interaction is involved at the beginning stages of the product cycle itself.
    
* **Kanban:** Kanban is a also highly used agile framework. Kanban doesn't have the concepts of sprints. Kanban uses the board approach where the tasks are written on the board. And the entire team focuses onto to deliver that functionality. Kanban uses smaller cycles to deliver the product represented on the Kanban board.
    

## Agile Testing Lifecycle

Let's understand the agile testing lifecycle with an example. For instance, there is a requirement to make an e-commerce site that sells high-quality fabric. First, the requirement of the client is noted. Then, a development plan is laid out on the basis. Suppose six months are allocated for the product to release. 2 weeks of sprints have been divided. The first sprint authentication should be done, and UI should be done. Now development and testing are going parallel in the process. The developer does Gmail authentication, and parallel test cases that should be validated are being done. And in two weeks, the developed part is released. The same methodology is followed throughout the product development period. Below diagram would make more impact in understanding what is agile methodology.

## Core Values of Agile

Agile methodology is very different from traditional systems like the waterfall model where there is a phase only after the completion of the previous phase.

**The four values agile follows are as follows:**

**1\. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools:** Agile methodology is centric on transparency in work. Who is responsible, what has been done, and what is left is known to all. Hence, a more communication-centric process.

**2\. Working software over comprehensive documentation:** Agile process is a prototype-based model where there are continuous releases and updates. The process is more development centric than theoretical.

**3\. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:** Continuous testing signifies that user feedback is crucial to the development cycle. Customers'/users' input is added to the product at every cycle stage.

**4\. Responding to change by following a plan:** Agile method is a flexible model, unlike the waterfall, where the entire cycle needs to be followed for every feature. Change requests are prioritized and responded to in the fastest possible manner.

## Principles of Agile Methodology

1. **Satisfy the Customer Through Early and Continuous Delivery of Valuable Software:** Agile process is about fast-paced development. All the steps are still followed, and changes are validated, verified, and delivered, but there is not too much unnecessary documentation. CI/CD tools and automation is used wherever the developer can.
    
2. **Welcome Changing Requirements, Even Late in Development:** Waterfall approach is used to take one step at a time, unlike Agile. The agile process involves incoming changes and adding them to the next release. The bugs are also prioritized and, fixed, added to the next version itself.
    
3. **Deliver Working Software Frequently:** Agile framework believes in continuous product delivery in phases. This reduces the burden on both client and the team. New features and bugs are fixed in the next release.
    
4. **Business People and Developers Must Work Together:** Agile team includes business analysts, product managers, testers and developers. Product management software like JIRA is so transparent that everyone knows the ongoing task list, pending ones, and backlogs. All work together for the timely delivery of the product.
    
5. **Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals:** The agile process is more oriented towards people than tools and processes. Hence, the project is all about people and teamwork. The best part of this model is that everyone knows who is doing what, and all are working together to deliver the project.
    
6. **Promote Face-to-Face Conversations:** Since every task is so transparent. Boards and graphs make the process even smoother. Agile promotes more communication and conversation to reach the target together as there is no blame game here.
    
7. **Working Software Is the Primary Measure of Progress:** The agile methodology is never about documentation but only about improving product quality. The ultimate product surrounds success, improvement, and everything. The process is also enhanced so that the product becomes much more efficient.
    
8. **Agile Processes Promote Sustainable Development:** Agile process is the practical model. There are no crafted deadlines. It's all a team working together at the same time. The optimum utilization of resources is the primary aspect of the process.
    
9. **Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design Enhances Agility:** The primary aspect of agile is to deliver a quality product timely. The product has to be efficient, secure, and reliable. It is a long journey with smaller goals and milestones to achieve.
    
10. **Simplicity—the Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Being Done—is Essential:** Agile team consists of business analysts, managers, testers, developers, and the DevOps team. Agile is all about collaboration and commitment to achieving the common objective of delivering a quality product in the market.
    
11. **The Best Architectures, Requirements, and Designs Emerge from Self-organizing Teams:** Agile methodology believes in more collaboration and exchange of information. When many highly motivated individuals work together, the best ideas are bound to happen. The collaboration is to find smarter ways to approach the product and designs. The refinement keeps on happening throughout the cycle.
    
12. **Have Regular Intervals:** Agile processes like Scrum have sprints. Sprint and continuous releases allow more changes, collaboration, and faster processes, but the intervals should remain constant that is if the sprints from starting are two weeks, they should remain like that.
    

## Scrum Artefacts

Scrum Artifacts are terminologies in agile methodology. All the team members get a gist of the product development cycle by looking at these definitions. There are multiple terminologies in the scrum framework called scrum artefacts. Artefacts provide crucial information about the tasks under the development cycle. Below is listed one of the most crucial ones. Scrum is a framework for managing the product development cycle, and its special feature is sprint. Scrum framework follows scrum ceremonies and tools to manage the project, like JIRA.

The seven scrum artefacts are:

1. **Product Vision:** Product vision artefacts have documentation about the product's exact vision. This document would act as a reference for the entire to look up in case of any discrepancy. Product vision is a short note; around this, all the functionalities are built.
    
2. **Product Backlog:** Product backlog lists all the functionalities that need to be built. It consists of functional requirements, assets, non-functional requirements, features, and knowledge acquisition. These features are then subdivided into smaller units. Product backlog keeps updating as new features get an add-on or when there is a requirement change.
    
3. **Sprint Vision:** Sprint Vision or Sprint Goal is the high-level objective a print project manager wants to achieve. So, a task list has already been created in the product backlog. Some are part of the club together to achieve in a sprint. For example, the product requires one year to develop. In the first month, the list of tasks that the project manager aspires to achieve is listed as a group as a sprint. And the objective of that sprint would become sprint vision.
    
4. **Sprint Backlog:** Sprint backlog lists all the activities to be delivered by the end of the sprint. For example, a product requires a login module, blog module, and payment gateway. By the end of the first two weeks- the UI would be ready, and authentication would be done. So all tasks that have to be submitted by week 2 are part of the sprint backlog.
    
5. **Definition of Done (DOD):** The Definition of Done is a set of checklists that, when completed then, only would ensure the task is done. For instance, in the sprint, one authentication module must be done. DOD of it would be the test case of Gmail, Facebook, and basic authentication are passes then only sprint one is complete.
    
6. **Product Increment:** Product increment artefacts denote all the tasks of the product backlog that are DOD plus the tasks of the previous sprint. Increment itself defines what all new features have been done among the product backlog task list.
    
7. **Burndown Chart:** Burndown chart is a graphical chart depicting all the completed activities versus time. The chart burns down to zero when all the tasks are marked done. It is a progress task that would tell in how much duration % of tasks that are done.
    

Scrum framework is a product handling mechanism. And this entire setup is made completely transparent. At every stage, the product owner assigns user stories to developers. Who has done it, in what duration, and why the development is falling back can be easily visible. The entire SDLC process has been made reliable that scrum is the truth. The scrum team must have visibility of all the artifacts at every stage of the development period.
