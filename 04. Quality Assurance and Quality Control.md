# 04. Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Quality assurance in software testing is one of the unsaid promises by a company before releasing the product into the market. The product goes through multiple rounds of testing at every stage of product development.

Quality Control is just one aspect of quality assurance, as assurance means that the product has been tested to match the market's standard.

## What is Quality Assurance?

Quality Assurance is a process to ensure the product is well-tested, secured, and up to market standards. The product's quality is enhanced in the process. The assurance is a guarantee which tells the product is safe to use. In the process, the product is made efficient and effective to use.

## Importance of Quality Assurance

1. Quality Assurance provides a reputation for the company. Any product company release has been well-tested.
    
2. Product defects create a bad image in the market and could put the company in legal trouble.
    
3. In any phishing attack, the company can produce a document of being well-tested to keep the brand image intact.
    
4. Quality assurance also improves the effectiveness of the entire development cycle. Every process gets more defined and disciplined.
    

## What is the Quality Attribute of Software?

1. **Functionality:** The basic functionalities of the software must be working fine. The entire series of actions should be smooth. The integration of one module into another should not have defects. *For example*, on an e-commerce site, users should be able to add and remove updated items in the cart without failure.
    
2. **Performance:** The server should not crash on load increase. The loading speed should not be too slow. The overall experience with the application should be smooth. The maximum time limit must not exceed, and the application should also be operatable with a poor connection.
    
3. **Reliability:** The application has to be reliable to take variable factors in extreme directions to have the trust of users. Incorrect responses, failure, power cuts, and internet connection failures must all be handled.
    
4. **Security:** Security should be the number one priority of every company before releasing a product on the market. Customers' data must be secured. The application should thoroughly go through security testing at every stage. There should be no compromise on security.
    

## Process of Quality Assurance

1. **Planning Stage:** Quality assurance entire process has to be established. Standards at every stage and structure to handle should be laid out. Every stage in the development cycle needs to have quality management.
    
2. **Development Stage:** Quality assurance has much to do with testing the product. The product has to be tested thoroughly for both functional and non-function requirements.
    
3. **Maintenance Stage:** Monitoring the process, validating using charts and graphs to see improvements made vs. need. The quality assurance process also must be continuously evolving.
    

## Some common SQA tools

**Quality Assurance** is done at every stage of the development cycle. Hence, the tools used in the process are as follows :

1. **Project Management tools:**
    
    * Release Management tools like JIRA
        
    * Source Control like GIT, SVN
        
2. **Code Reviews:**
    
    * Code Analysis using automation tools for framework and naming conventions.
        
    * Code Reviews manually by experts in the industry
        
3. **Testing Tools:**
    
    * Test management using TestNG, JUnit
        
    * Bug tracking using Bugzilla
        
    * Cross-browser testing using Selenium
        
    * Usability Testing is done manually
        
    * Load Testing using Apache JMeter
        
    * CI/CD tools using Jenkins
        
4. **Monitoring Tools:**
    
    * Business Analysis using charts
        
    * Log Monitoring using log4j
        
    * Performance Monitoring tools at sever
        
5. **Manual Customer Support**
    

## SQA Certifications

1. **ISO 9000:** ISO 9000 was set up in 1987 for quality management. ISO 9000 certification audits the company for its product, process, services, and approach. This certification enhances customer satisfaction and increases the profit of the company.
    
2. **CMMI(Capability Maturity Model Integrated) LEVEL:** CMMI focuses on process improvement in the software development cycle. It consists of 5 levels based on their development model's maturity.
    
    * **Initial(level 1):**  
        The quality management process is basic here, not structured and well-set.
        
    * **Repeatable(level 2):**  
        A primary level of quality audit system is set up, which is even repeatable throughout the development cycle.
        
    * **Defined(level 3):**  
        A defined and structured management system is ensured in the project.
        
    * **Managed(level 4):**  
        An efficient management system with metrics and monitoring tools is applied throughout the product cycle.
        
    * **Optimizing(level 5) :**  
        An advanced management system growing and enhancing daily. Quality management is given high priority in the company.
        
3. **TMM(Test Maturity Model):** The test Maturity Model also follows five levels as CMMI, definitions of them are as follows :
    
    * **Initial(level 1):**  
        TMM level 1 is the lowest level where a primary quality management system is applied.
        
    * **Repeatable(level 2):**  
        TMM level 2 quality management where a basic level of quality enhancement is repeated.
        
    * **Integration(level 3):**  
        V model where testing is done repeatedly at every stage is how level 3 looks like
        
    * **Managed(level 4):**  
        A good management system with cautious validation of fluctuation using metrics and monitoring tools. Nowadays, very meticulous tools are provided by the server and established in the development cycle.
        
    * **Optimizing(level 5):**  
        Many automation tools and strategies are used to continuously improve the system and product quality at the same phase level.
        

## What is Quality Control?

Quality Control is a process in which a product is tested for correctness and efficiency to match a standard. Through quality control, the product's quality is enhanced, and the product is made safer to use. Quality control includes making products defect-free, consistent, and reliable.

## Importance of Quality Control

1. Quality control brings trust among the users for the product. It helps to build a brand. **The best example in India is Tata.**
    
2. Quality control brings a quantitative measure to the extent that the product has been tested and made efficient to use.
    
3. Quality control brings any product to market standards. Hence, a high-quality product has reached the market.
    
4. Quality Control is a safety net for companies. In case of severe bugs, the company can inform the government that a well-tested product was released, and human errors will always be there.
    
5. In case of failure in quality control, the company can receive severe backlash and even, in extreme conditions, lawsuits.
    

## Types of Quality Control

There are a lot of quality control methods. Some are as below:

* **Control Charts:** To improve the quality of a product, when you compare the statistics or configuration of a product over time, you get what parameters need to be focussed on, and graphs help you in that is called control charts. For example, when you look at the landing page's speed at different release intervals, you can improve the quality.
    
* **Process Control:** When the process is enhanced and made more efficient, the product automatically improves. The entire cycle gets better. This approach comes under process control. For example, when you see more sub-points getting added in requirement gathering, that means a definition to that task is being added.
    
* **Acceptance Sampling:** When the acceptance criteria increase, the product needs to be enhanced to reach the standard. This process comes under acceptance sampling. For example, when a speed of 5s is added as the minimum acceptance criteria for page loading, one can easily identify the concerning pages to work on.
    
* **Process Protocol:** The STLC process in particular is not disciplined. When the phases get standardized to meet a particular level, it comes under process protocol. For example, from the date assigned to delivery, the duration must not be more than 15 days, so that protocol is set up.
    

## Quality Control Process

* **Planning:** Quality Control is planned here. The criteria, implementation, techniques, method, and duration all is planned. Software testing is a part of the quality control process.
    
* **Execution:** The constant process of verification in the development cycle and implementation of quality control. For instance, checking the performance speed of the application after every release and ensuring it is under the desired acceptance criteria.
    
* **Validation:** Once the quality control process is executed, the last step is to validate the well-tested product in the market for market acceptance.
    

## Some Common SQC Tools

1. **Flowchart:** Flow charts are an efficient way to determine the breakdown or bottleneck in the product. Flow charts typically depict the steps taken in the process cycle.
    
2. **Check Sheet:** Checksheet is a perfect way to find out all the questions related to the task, its efficiency, and its associated parameters. It also tells about the frequency of the occurrence of an event.
    
3. **Cause and Effect Diagram:** The cause-Effect graph not only perfectly documents the issue occurring but helps to figure out why that particular event is occurring, hence ways to fix it. Causes are also separated into people, processes, materials, and equipment.
    
4. **Control Charts:** Control Charts are used to find the pattern between data movement over some time. It helps in the quantitative measurement of the speed and performance of an event.
    
5. **Histograms:** Histograms are bar charts that depict how a pattern changes for a particular event. This diagram depicts variation in a very clean form.
    

## Quality Control versus Quality Assurance

| Quality Control | Quality Assurance |
| --- | --- |
| Quality Control signifies a testing process where a product is tested to be defect-free. | Quality Assurance signifies quality control is done and has been tested for the market |
| Quality Control is a sub-part of Quality Assurance | Quality Assurance is a superset of Quality control. |
| Quality control is for product quality verification | Quality assurance is for product quality validation. |
