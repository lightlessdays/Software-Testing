Software testing is a process where we **validate** that the product developed is as per the requirement of the client. Software is ensured that it is **defect free**, **safe to use**, and **validated against different metrics**. Software is tested for security, user experience, speed, performance, load capacity, and many other parameters. Software development and software testing both are ongoing processes as every time a new functionality gets added, it is tested for its accuracy.

### Benefits of Software Testing

But why should we do Software Testing? Well... software testing has several benefits. Here are some benefits of software testing:

1. **Accuracy:** Software testing answers all the necessary questions like how much load a server can take, the speed of the site, and the safety of data to define the reliability of the product.
    
2. **Saves cost:** It's a well-known concept in the software development world that the earlier the defect is detected, the cheaper its cost of fixing. Because once that defect goes to the user's end, the damage could cost the company.
    
3. **Saves time:** Software testing **saves time in the long run** as it does not lead the new changes to go to the next stage till has been tested properly but the testing team against all the necessary parameters which ensures a high-quality product is going every next stage.
    
4. **Product quality:** Since the product is tested against the necessary metrics, **product quality improves**. A well-tested product reaches the market.
    
5. **Trust factor:** Software testing builds trust in the company as well as among users. As the product is well tested, the company remains confident in handling any possible outburst. And that confidence gets reflected in their product marketing and hence among users.
    

### Steps of Software Testing

Software Testing can be divided into two steps:

1. **Verification:** Software testing ensures that the product we are building is defect free, and secure, as per the client's requirement and user's expectations. It is tested against all the parameters to deliver a quality product.
    
2. **Validation:** Validation in software testing emphasizes where the product is being built is the right fit for the market. For instance, when Google Glass was built, it was a high-quality product that checked all the technical parameters. But when Google Glass was brought into the industry, it was immediately banned by a lot of governments because of security and privacy obligations. So, Google Glass was a well-verified but not validated product.
    

Let us tabulate the differences between verification and validation to properly understand the difference between them.

| **Verification** | **Validation** |
| --- | --- |
| Verification focuses on building a technically sound product. | Validation focuses on building the right product for the market. |
| Verification is done on all the technical parameters like performance, load, and security. | Validation focuses on market size, pricing of products, industry requirements, use cases, etc. |
| Verification can only be done by the testing team. | Validation is done mainly by the Business Analyst team. |
| Verification is done after a feature is developed. | Validation is done before a feature goes into development. |

### Principles of Software Testing

Software Testing is guided by seven principles. These seven principles, known as the principles of Software Testing, are listed below:

1. **Testing shows the presence of defects:**
    
    One important aspect of testing is that it shows the presence of a defect and not the absence of it. The purpose of testing is not to ensure that the product is 100% bug-free but to work hard, finding creative ways to locate a bug in the software. It's not about writing 1000 test cases that are passed, but writing those 10 cases which are more likely to fail.
    
2. **Exhaustive Testing is not possible:**
    
    Before testing any application, one thing to remember is that you cannot test every test case scenario. Neither manually nor automate it. The reason for the same would be add-on cost on time and budget. Also, it's not even feasible to replicate the exact and every possible test environment. Hence, testing is done on a priority basis. And that's one of the reasons why every bug is given priority and severity.
    
3. **Early Testing**
    
    Currently, in the industry, Agile methodology is used instead of waterfall. Agile signifies testing, and development is a parallel process. It's a well-known fact that the earlier the bug is predicted, the cheaper its cost is to fix. And with time, cost increases exponentially. Suppose the code is in the development stage. The damage a bug would do can still get controlled. But the same bug, when it reaches production, can cost millions. So, the earlier the testing better it is.
    
4. **Defect Clustering**
    
    Clustering means grouping. It's an observed phenomenon that only a few modules carry the most amount of bugs. And usually, the ones that have the main integration going on. And the reason is also when testing is done via lack of creativity. Manual testing is a skill set developed over the years and helps to identify those risky modules.
    
5. **Pesticide Paradox**
    
    In the agriculture field, when the same pesticide is used over a decent duration. Insects develop resistance to the pesticide and get unaffected. The same lies with software testing. When the same techniques, strategies, and tools are used for every functionality, crucial bugs remain in the software. And software testing is a skill where regular upskilling is a necessity. Even the tools that come up are based on the limitations of previous tools. Continuous upgrade with technology is a necessity to survive in the testing industry.
    
6. **Testing is context-dependent**
    
    Testing is context-dependent, meaning the same testing strategy cannot be used within the same product or even for different functionalities in the same product. For instance, the thought process for testing UI is more validation centric, whereas an API is more security-centric. Testing strategy changes with the technology also. Testing a website on ReactJs and Angular would involve different performance metrics. And when testing any e-commerce site, security and payment become huge risks and priority factors.
    
7. **Absence of errors fallacy**
    
    The absence of errors fallacy comes from the concept of verification and validation. Software tested with multiple rounds of testing and proven to be 99% defect free can still not be validated in the market. For example, highly advanced drones for surveillance and testing to give accurate results still be not allowed by the government for privacy concerns. So, the goal is not only to create a bug-free product but also a usable one.
    

### Software Testing Tools

Software testing tools have made automation testing possible. We integrate these Software Testing Tools into the script, and they run the test case. Based on the result, a report is attached to them.

For example, the Selenium automation tool is used to automate the browser. We write a script in Java/Python/javascript called the Selenium web driver using Selenium libraries, and with the help of libraries only, we automate the webpage. Once the execution is done, an extensive report is attached to it. The entire run is done on the testNG library.

But there are also tools like Bugzilla, and Jira, which do not help automate a test case but act as bug management. Jenkins, for instance, is used as CI/CD tool. So all these in a single automation framework work in collaboration. Below, we are going to list the different types of Software Testing Tools we have.

#### Types of tools

There are eight kinds of software testing tools:

1. **UI automation tool:** UI automation software testing tools are used to automate the user experience with the application. Scripts are written by clicking a button, filling out the form, scroll down the screen. Selenium has been the most used in the industry for many years now. Cypress is for javascript developers, and Katalon Studio is built on top of Selenium to provide a GUI interface for UI automation.
    
2. **API automation tool:** API automation software testing tools like Postman, RestAssured, and SoapUI are used to test web services and API. These tools don't require much coding, but one can validate if an API is working and if requests and responses attach to it.
    
3. **Performance tool:** Performance software testing tools like LoadRunner and Apache Jmeter test the server's load. You can send multiple requests to the server, and within a few seconds, a response time graph is obtainedâ€”for both load and stress testing.
    
4. **Test case management:** Test management tools like JIRA with XRays automate the test case management process. Earlier the entire entry was done manually in Excel sheets. Now JIRA can be integrated into source code and generate reports of test cases pending.
    
5. **Bug management tool:** Bugzilla is a popular tool that helps identify a bug's status. Who is assigned to it, severity, and priority of the bug? Earlier, this was all done in an Excel sheet which was challenging to manage.
    
6. **Mobile automation tool:** Appium is used to automate mobile experience. The same Selenium does with browsers, Appium does with mobile automation. Tester writes a script and adds Appium libraries which replicate user interaction of click, scroll, volume, etc., features.
    
7. **Build automation tool:** Jenkins is one of the most used tools. It is a CI/CD tool that is used to automate the build so that a tester can schedule the test execution time. The build would automatically run, and the associated report would be generated.
    
8. **Test Environment tools:** LambdaTest, SauceLabs, and BrowserStack provide test environments that allow testers to run their code on desired system configuration.
    

Let us now explore some famous tools that every tester must know, starting with Selenium.
